\chapter{Installing AIF360}\label{app_Install}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item In this book we will use Python in Jupyter notebooks from the \href{https://www.anaconda.com//products/individual}{Anaconda Python distribution platform}. If you don't already have it download and install it.

\newline

\item Create an environment named \texttt{mbml}. Using the command line interface (CLI):
\begin{lstlisting}
\$ conda create --name mbml python=3.7
\end{lstlisting}
%
\item Activate your new environment:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ conda activate mbml
\end{lstlisting}
%
%\item Install AIF360:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%$ pip install 'aif360[all]'
%\end{lstlisting}
%
\item This book is a work in progress. As part of analysing the metrics and methods it uses code that is not yet available with the library\footnote{If you're interested, here is the \href{https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/pull/214}{open pull request}.}. Once it is merged, you will just be able to just pip install the aif360 library. Until then you must clone this \href{https://github.com/leenamurgai/AIF360}{fork of AIF360}:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
$ git clone https://github.com/leenamurgai/AIF360.git
\end{lstlisting}
%
\item Download the notebook \texttt{mbml\_german.ipynb} from \href{https://git.manning.com/agileauthor/murgai/-/blob/master/code/mbml\_german.ipynb}{Manning's GitLab repository} and save it in the "AIF360/examples" folder.
%
\newline
%
\item You should now be able to open and run the notebook from the CLI as you usually would:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ jupyter notebook mbml_german.ipynb
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
