\subsection{Sum rule}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn_SumRuleD}
\Prob(x) = \sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} \Prob(x,y)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Product rule}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn_ProductRuleD}
\Prob(x,y) = \Prob(y|x) \Prob(x)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bayes' rule}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn_BayesRuleD}
\Prob(y|x) = \frac{\Prob(x|y)\Prob(y)}{\Prob(x)}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Independence}

For $X \bot Y$
\begin{align}
\Prob(x,y)   & = \Prob(x) \Prob(y) \label{eqn_Indep1D} \\
\Prob(y|x)   & = \Prob(y)          \label{eqn_Indep2D}
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Conditional Independence}

For $X \bot Y | Z$ (or equivalently $Y \bot X | Z$ by symmetry)
\begin{equation} \label{eqn_CondIndep1D}
\Prob(x|y,z) = \Prob(x|z)
\end{equation}
and by symmetry,
\begin{equation} \label{eqn_CondIndep2D}
\Prob(y|x,z) = \Prob(y|z)
\end{equation}
Using the product rule followed by \ref{eqn_CondIndep2D} we also have,
\begin{align}
\Prob(x,y|z)       & = \Prob(y|x,z)\Prob(x|z) \nonumber \\
                   & = \Prob(y|z)\Prob(x|z)   \label{eqn_CondIndep3D}
\end{align}

\subsection{Sum rule}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn_SumRuleC}
f_{X}(X) = \int f_{X,Y}(x,y) \, \dee y
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Product rule}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn_ProductRuleC}
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_{Y|X}(x,y) f_X(x)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bayes' rule}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn_BayesRuleC}
f_{Y|X}(x,y) = \frac{f_{X|Y}(x,y) f_Y(y)}{f_X(x)}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Independence}

For $X \bot Y$
\begin{align}
f_{X,Y}(x,y) & = f_X(x)f_Y(y) \label{eqn_Indep1C} \\
f_{Y|X}(x,y) & = f_Y(y)       \label{eqn_Indep2C}
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Conditional Independence}

For $X \bot Y | Z$ (or equivalently $Y \bot X | Z$ by symmetry)
\begin{equation} \label{eqn_CondIndep1C}
f_{X|Y,Z}(x,y,z) = f_{X|Z}(x,z)
\end{equation}
and by symmetry,
\begin{equation} \label{eqn_CondIndep2C}
f_{Y|X,Z}(x,y,z) = f_{Y|Z}(y,z)
\end{equation}
Using the product rule followed by \ref{eqn_CondIndep2C} we also have,
\begin{align}
f_{X,Y|Z}(x,y,z) & = f_{Y|X,Z}(x,y,z)f_{X|Z}(x,z) \nonumber \\
                 & = f_{Y|Z}(y,z)f_{X|Z}(x,y)  \label{eqn_CondIndep3C}
\end{align}
